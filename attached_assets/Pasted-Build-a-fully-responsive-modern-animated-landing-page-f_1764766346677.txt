Build a fully responsive, modern, animated landing page for a product called **mysaarti.in**.

### Overall concept
mysaarti.in is an **Indian citizen-first AI grievance & civic support platform** that helps people raise complaints, auto-file them to authorities, optionally share them on social media, and track them until resolution. The website should look like a **slick startup landing page** with an Indian touch, lots of micro-interactions, and smooth animations.

Use:
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS via CDN (for quick styling)
- Vanilla JavaScript for animations & interactions
- Font Awesome (via CDN) for icons

No build tools, no frameworks like React; everything should work as a simple static site.

#### 3. “How It Works” Section

Four horizontal steps with icons (use Font Awesome):

Title: **How mysaarti.in Works**

Each step is a card with icon + heading + description and a hover animation (lift + glow):

1. **Raise**
   - Icon: fa-microphone or fa-comment-dots
   - Text: “Speak or type in Indian languages. Add photos or videos of the issue.”

2. **Auto-File**
   - Icon: fa-paper-plane
   - Text: “mysaarti.in structures your complaint and files it to the right authorities.”

3. **Boost (Optional)**
   - Icon: fa-bullhorn
   - Text: “Share on Twitter/Instagram to increase public visibility and accountability.”

4. **Track & Resolve**
   - Icon: fa-chart-line
   - Text: “Track status, follow-ups, and resolution in one unified timeline.”

Use a slight scroll-in animation for each card.

#### 4. AI Features Section

Title: **AI-Powered Civic Assistant**

Layout: Two-column (text on left, stylized illustration block on right).

Bullet points with icons:
- “Smart department detection & routing”
- “Government-style formal complaint drafting”
- “Urgency and sentiment scoring”
- “FAQ and rights suggestions for similar issues”
- “Pattern spotting for recurring civic problems”

On the right, create a nice card that looks like a chatbot conversation with:
- A citizen message (simple text)
- AI’s structured breakdown of the complaint.

Add subtle glow/animation around this card to emphasize “AI magic”.

#### 5. Analytics Section

Title: **Civic Insights & Trend Analytics**

Description: Explain that mysaarti.in can generate heatmaps, resolution time charts, and trending issues.

Show **three analytic cards** with mini charts (use simple CSS shapes to fake charts):

- Card 1: “Issue Hotspots” — a mini heatmap-like colored grid.
- Card 2: “Resolution Performance” — a fake line chart going up.
- Card 3: “Emerging Issues” — a list of sample tags like “Potholes ↑”, “Water Logging ↑”, “Streetlights ↓”.

Cards should have hover animations and slight staggered scroll-in animations.

Each card:

#### 9. Contact / Footer Section

Contact section:
- Simple form with:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message / “Tell us your civic challenge”
- Form should be styled nicely with focus states and micro-animations.
- This is a front-end only form; no real backend submission needed, but add basic JS validation.

Footer:

- Links:
  - Features
  - Privacy Policy (dummy link)
  - Terms
  - Contact
- Small note: “© {current year} mysaarti.in • Built for India 🇮🇳”

---

### Interactivity & Animations (Important)

- Use CSS and JavaScript for:
  - Scroll-based fade-in / slide-in animations on each section.
  - Smooth scrolling to sections when clicking navbar links.
  - Hover effects on buttons, cards, and icons.
  - Animated background shapes (slow float / pulse).
- Avoid over-the-top animations; keep it classy yet lively.

---

### Technical Requirements

- Single `index.html` file using TailwindCSS via CDN, Font Awesome via CDN, and inline or separate JS file.
- All styles should work without additional build steps.
- Make sure it’s mobile-first and looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- Organize code cleanly with comments marking each section (Hero, How It Works, etc.).

Create the complete HTML, CSS (via Tailwind classes), and JavaScript in one go so I can run it directly on Replit as a static website.
